# CHALLENGE
# The challenge uses several notions scattered throughout the day's exercises. If you don't feel up
# to it straight away, that's normal. Come back later to try again.
# You should compare your productions with others and discuss the pros and cons of each solution.
# The best answers could be presented publicly.
# Write a snippet of code that counts the total of occurrences of the strings ”cat”, ”garden” and ”mice” in
# any string, considering that:
# ✓ each substring can be read left to right OR right to left ;
# ✓ matches must be case insensitive ;
# ✓ you should not bother with overlaps.

str = "cat", "garden", "mice"

print(str.count())
